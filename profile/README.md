# pymaitre
This organization is ment to have private tools for research aimed to help medical physicist in delivering tools for clinical usage. 
It is like a Maitre, not visible but present needed for an efficient and agile interaction with clinics. The idea behind is that we can have different maitres, 
with different tecnical profiles and from different institutes helping each other for the same scope.

Tools implemented:
### libsrdl
### medicalAI
### SQLHub
### dcm_folder
### dcm_anonymize
